# Graphic-Design-Portfolio
As a graphic design student who is looking for a way to show off her best projects and the outcomes. As a student, she is given a vast number of assignments that end with a final outcome which gets marked and forgotten about. What she is looking for is someone to create her website (which she designed) in order to have a collection of her best work online as a portfolio. The purpose of this website is for potential employers looking to hire her to have easy access to her best work as well as a way to always have her work digitally ready to show anyone interested in what she has created.
